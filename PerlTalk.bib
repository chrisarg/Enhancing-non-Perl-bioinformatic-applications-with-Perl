This novel procedure uses the template-switching activity of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase to synthesize and anchor first-strand cDNA in one step. Following reverse transcription, three cycles of PCR are performed using a modified oligo(dT) primer and an anchor primer to enrich the cDNA population for fulllength sequences. Starting with 1 μg human skeletal muscle poly(A)+ RNA, a cDNA library was constructed that contained 3 × 106 independent clones with an average insert size of 2 kb. Sequence analysis of 172 randomly selected clones showed that 77\% of cDNA clones corresponding to known genes contained intact open reading frames. The average length of complete open reading frames was 2.4 kb. Furthermore, 86\% of the full-length clones retained longer 5′ UTR sequences than the longest 5′ end deposited in the GenBank® database. cDNA libraries generated using this method will be useful for accelerating the collection of mRNA 5′ end sequence information, which is currently very limited in GenBank.},

	abstract = {One of the major goals of computational sequence analysis is to find sequence similarities, which could serve as evidence of structural and functional conservation, as well as of evolutionary relations among the sequences. Since the degree of similarity is usually assessed by the sequence alignment score, it is necessary to know if a score is high enough to indicate a biologically interesting alignment. A powerful approach to defining score cutoffs is based on the evaluation of the statistical significance of alignments. The statistical significance of an alignment score is frequently assessed by its P-value, which is the probability that this score or a higher one can occur simply by chance, given the probabilistic models for the sequences. In this review we discuss the general role of P-value estimation in sequence analysis, and give a description of theoretical methods and computational approaches to the estimation of statistical signifiance for important classes of sequence analysis problems. In particular, we concentrate on the P-value estimation techniques for single sequence studies (both score-based and score-free), global and local pairwise sequence alignments, multiple alignments, sequence-to-profile alignments and alignments built with hidden Markov models. We anticipate that the review will be useful both to researchers professionally working in bioinformatics as well as to biomedical scientists interested in using contemporary methods of DNA and protein sequence analysis.},

More recently, the advent of modern genomic sequencing and the volume of data it generates has resulted in a return to the problem of local alignment. We conclude with how the mathematical formulation of Levenshtein distance as a metric made possible additional optimizations to similarity search in biological contexts. These modern optimizations are built around the low metric entropy and fractional dimensionality of biological databases, enabling orders of magnitude acceleration of biological similarity search.},

	abstract = {k-mer-based methods are widely used in bioinformatics for various types of sequence comparisons. However, a single mutation will mutate k consecutive k-mers and make most k-mer-based applications for sequence comparison sensitive to variable mutation rates. Many techniques have been studied to overcome this sensitivity, for example, spaced k-mers and k-mer permutation techniques, but these techniques do not handle indels well. For indels, pairs or groups of small k-mers are commonly used, but these methods first produce k-mer matches, and only in a second step, a pairing or grouping of k-mers is performed. Such techniques produce many redundant k-mer matches owing to the size of k. Here, we propose strobemers as an alternative to k-mers for sequence comparison. Intuitively, strobemers consist of two or more linked shorter k-mers, where the combination of linked k-mers is decided by a hash function. We use simulated data to show that strobemers provide more evenly distributed sequence matches and are less sensitive to different mutation rates than k-mers and spaced k-mers. Strobemers also produce higher match coverage across sequences. We further implement a proof-of-concept sequence-matching tool StrobeMap and use synthetic and biological Oxford Nanopore sequencing data to show the utility of using strobemers for sequence comparison in different contexts such as sequence clustering and alignment scenarios.},

	abstract = {Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology revolutionized sequencing, offering a tremendous sequencing capacity with groundbreaking depth and accuracy, it continues to demonstrate serious limitations. In the early 2010s, the introduction of a novel set of sequencing methodologies, presented by two platforms, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (ONT), gave birth to third-generation sequencing (TGS). The innovative long-read technologies turn genome sequencing into an ease-of-handle procedure by greatly reducing the average time of library construction workflows and simplifying the process of de novo genome assembly due to the generation of long reads. Long sequencing reads produced by both TGS methodologies have already facilitated the decipherment of transcriptional profiling since they enable the identification of full-length transcripts without the need for assembly or the use of sophisticated bioinformatics tools. Long-read technologies have also provided new insights into the field of epitranscriptomics, by allowing the direct detection of RNA modifications on native RNA molecules. This review highlights the advantageous features of the newly introduced TGS technologies, discusses their limitations and provides an in-depth comparison regarding their scientific background and available protocols as well as their potential utility in research and clinical applications.},

Currently, each of these goals is addressed by separate sequencing experiments given the different physical characteristics of RNA species from biological samples. Sequencing of both short and long RNAs from the same experimental run has not been reported for long-read Nanopore sequencing to date and only recently has been achieved for short-read (Illumina) methods. We propose a library preparation method capable of simultaneously profiling short and long RNA reads in the same library on the Nanopore platform and provide the relevant bioinformatics workflows to support the goals of RNA quantification. Using a variety of synthetic samples we demonstrate that the proposed method can simultaneously detect short and long RNAs in a manner that is linear over 5 orders of magnitude for RNA abundance and three orders of magnitude for RNA length. In biological samples the proposed method is capable of profiling a wider variety of short and long non-coding RNAs when compared against the existing Smart-seq protocols for Illumina and Nanopore sequencing.Competing Interest StatementA provisional patent covering the single tube modification and the bioinformatics workflow of PALS-NS has been filed to the US Patent Office by CA.},

	abstract = {Background
The use of novel algorithmic techniques is pivotal to many important problems in life science. For example the sequencing of the human genome (Venter et al., 2001) would not have been possible without advanced assembly algorithms and the development of practical BWT based read mappers have been instrumental for NGS analysis. However, owing to the high speed of technological progress and the urgent need for bioinformatics tools, there was a widening gap between state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques and the actual algorithmic components of tools that are in widespread use. We previously addressed this by introducing the SeqAn library of efficient data types and algorithms in 2008 (Döring et al., 2008).
Results
The SeqAn library has matured considerably since its first publication 9 years ago. In this article we review its status as an established resource for programmers in the field of sequence analysis and its contributions to many analysis tools.
Conclusions
We anticipate that SeqAn will continue to be a valuable resource, especially since it started to actively support various hardware acceleration techniques in a systematic manner.},

	abstract = {Arm usage has substantially grown in the High-Performance Computing (HPC) community. Japanese supercomputer Fugaku, powered by Arm-based A64FX processors, held the top position on the Top500 list between June 2020 and June 2022, currently sitting in the fourth position. The recently released 7th generation of Amazon EC2 instances for compute-intensive workloads (C7 g) is also powered by Arm Graviton3 processors. Projects like European Mont-Blanc and U.S. DOE/NNSA Astra are further examples of Arm irruption in HPC. In parallel, over the last decade, the rapid improvement of genomic sequencing technologies and the exponential growth of sequencing data has placed a significant bottleneck on the computational side. While most genomics applications have been thoroughly tested and optimized for x86 systems, just a few are prepared to perform efficiently on Arm machines. Moreover, these applications do not exploit the newly introduced Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE). This paper presents GenArchBench, the first genome analysis benchmark suite targeting Arm architectures. We have selected computationally demanding kernels from the most widely used tools in genome data analysis and ported them to Arm-based A64FX and Graviton3 processors. Overall, the GenArch benchmark suite comprises 13 multi-core kernels from critical stages of widely-used genome analysis pipelines, including base-calling, read mapping, variant calling, and genome assembly. Our benchmark suite includes different input data sets per kernel (small and large), each with a corresponding regression test to verify the correctness of each execution automatically. Moreover, the porting features the usage of the novel Arm SVE instructions, algorithmic and code optimizations, and the exploitation of Arm-optimized libraries. We present the optimizations implemented in each kernel and a detailed performance evaluation and comparison of their performance on four different HPC machines (i.e., A64FX, Graviton3, Intel Xeon Skylake Platinum, and AMD EPYC Rome). Overall, the experimental evaluation shows that Graviton3 outperforms other machines on average. Moreover, we observed that the performance of the A64FX is significantly constrained by its small memory hierarchy and latencies. Additionally, as proof of concept, we study the performance of a production-ready tool that exploits two of the ported and optimized genomic kernels.},

	abstract = {The approximate string matching problem is to find all locations at which a query of lengthm matches a substring of a text of length n with k-or-fewer differences. Simple and practical bit-vector algorithms have been designed for this problem, most notably the one used in agrep. These algorithms compute a bit representation of the current state-set of the k-difference automaton for the query, and asymptotically run in either O(nm/w) or O(nm log σ/w) time where w is the word size of the machine (e.g., 32 or 64 in practice), and σ is the size of the pattern alphabet. Here we present an algorithm of comparable simplicity that requires only O(nm/w) time by virtue of computing a bit representation of the relocatable dynamic programming matrix for the problem. Thus, the algorithm's performance is independent of k, and it is found to be more efficient than the previous results for many choices of k and smallm. Moreover, because the algorithm is not dependent on k, it can be used to rapidly compute blocks of the dynamic programming matrix as in the 4-Russians algorithm of Wu et al.(1996). This gives rise to an O(kn/w) expected-time algorithm for the case where m may be arbitrarily large. In practice this new algorithm, that computes a region of the dynamic progr amming (d.p.) matrx w entries at a time using the basic algorithm as a subroutine is significantly faster than our previous 4-Russians algorithm, that computes the same region 4 or 5 entries at a time using table lookup. This performance improvement yields a code that is either superior or competitive with all existing algorithms except for some filtration algorithms that are superior when k/m is sufficiently small.},

However, they suffer from linear artifacts that show as failures in linearity-related statistical tests such as the binary-rank and the linear-complexity test. In this article, we give two new contributions. First, we introduce two new F2-linear transformations that have been handcrafted to have good statistical properties and at the same time to be programmable very efficiently on superscalar processors, or even directly in hardware. Then, we describe some scramblers, that is, nonlinear functions applied to the state array that reduce or delete the linear artifacts, and propose combinations of linear transformations and scramblers that give extremely fast pseudorandom number generators of high quality. A novelty in our approach is that we use ideas from the theory of filtered linear-feedback shift registers to prove some properties of our scramblers, rather than relying purely on heuristics. In the end, we provide simple, extremely fast generators that use a few hundred bits of memory, have provable properties, and pass strong statistical tests.},
